ModRank

This program has the following features:

- evaluates all mods on items and identifies which are prefixes and suffixes, plus any 'alternate' mappings of prefixes and suffixes that would satisfy the item's values
- handles all 'combined' mods (Armor+%/Stun Recovery+%, etc), including item rarity+% as both a prefix and suffix
- uses a mod weighting system (user-configurable csv files) to rank the item's "worth" (weighting systems for different builds/classes can be created...several examples are included)
- calculates a percentile for each item, showing where it fits in the RNG roles that are possible for it
- focuses on giving the user a quick idea of how valuable an item is, with the ability to drill down and get further information if needed

Here are some screenshots...the main interface:
